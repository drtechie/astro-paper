### EXPLAIN and ANALYZE

Consider a simple query like

```sql
SELECT * from people WHERE id = 200;
```

If we want to understand the execution plan of the above statement, we can prefix the statement with EXPLAIN.

```sql
learning_test=> EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM people WHERE id = 200;
                                QUERY PLAN
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Index Scan using people_pkey on people  (cost=0.42..8.44 rows=1 width=17)
   Index Cond: (id = 200)
(2 rows)
```

The query plan shows how the tables and indexes will be scanned by the database.
In the above output, we can see that index `people_pkey` is scanned to get the rows.
We will look at different types of 'scans' below.
The important part of the EXPLAIN output is the cost.
The values are arbitrary, it signifies the amount of page fetches the DB has to perform.
When tweaking and optimizing SQL statements, look out for how the cost changes.

`cost=X..Y`

The cost section shows 2 values. The first one (X) is the startup cost and the second one (Y) is the total cost.
Most of the time, you need to look at how the total cost changes.

The EXPLAIN statement takes more options.
Coupling EXPLAIN with ANALYZE will actually execute the query and provide statistics of the execution.

```sql
learning_test=> EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM people WHERE id = 200;
                                                     QUERY PLAN
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Index Scan using people_pkey on people  (cost=0.42..8.44 rows=1 width=17) (actual time=0.616..0.620 rows=1 loops=1)
   Index Cond: (id = 200)
 Planning Time: 0.077 ms
 Execution Time: 0.646 ms
(4 rows)
```

You can now see additional time parameters have been added to the output.

### Sequential Scan

Let's see the query plan for `SELECT` of everything from the table `people`.

```sql
learning_test=> EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM people;
                                                    QUERY PLAN
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Seq Scan on people  (cost=0.00..16329.00 rows=1000000 width=17) (actual time=0.009..74.236 rows=1000000 loops=1)
 Planning Time: 0.053 ms
 Execution Time: 115.517 ms
(3 rows)
```

The database has to literally scan the whole table to get the output.
It goes through every `page` in the `heap` and all rows are fetched.
This type of scan is one of the simplest but also the costliest scans for large tables.

### Index Scan

At the start of the article, we did a query where we found the row matching ID = 200.

```sql
learning_test=> EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM people WHERE id = 200;
                                                     QUERY PLAN
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Index Scan using people_pkey on people  (cost=0.42..8.44 rows=1 width=17) (actual time=0.616..0.620 rows=1 loops=1)
   Index Cond: (id = 200)
 Planning Time: 0.077 ms
 Execution Time: 0.646 ms
(4 rows)
```

Let's see how this output is different from the sequential scan.
First, the index `people_pkey` is used. Postgres has automatically created an index for the primary key of the table (ID).

`rows=1`

The estimated number of rows returned by the query is mentioned here.
As expected, only one row matches the unique primary key ID = 200.
Note that the sequential scan query had `rows=1000000` which is the entire table.

### Index Only Scan

Now, consider the below query.
Well, this might sound stupid. We are selecting the id along with the condition of the same ID.

```sql
learning_test=> SELECT id FROM people WHERE id = 200;
 id
-----
 200
(1 row)
```

Let's check the query plan for this query.

```sql
learning_test=> EXPLAIN ANALYSE SELECT id FROM people WHERE id = 200;
                                                       QUERY PLAN
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Index Only Scan using people_pkey on people  (cost=0.42..4.44 rows=1 width=4) (actual time=0.022..0.023 rows=1 loops=1)
   Index Cond: (id = 200)
   Heap Fetches: 0
 Planning Time: 0.072 ms
 Execution Time: 0.039 ms
(5 rows)
```

From the execution time, you can see how this query will give the result in a 'split-millisecond'.
Index-only scans are the fastest queries.
Here DB does not have to go to the heap to fetch any data.
Everything that the query needs resides within the index itself.

### Bitmap Scans

Let's revisit the query from [chapter 02](#) and fetch all the people who are 40 years old.

```sql
learning_test=> EXPLAIN ANALYSE SELECT * FROM people WHERE age = 40;
                                                           QUERY PLAN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Bitmap Heap Scan on people  (cost=109.79..6861.53 rows=9467 width=17) (actual time=1.633..9.113 rows=10176 loops=1)
   Recheck Cond: (age = 40)
   Heap Blocks: exact=5045
   ->  Bitmap Index Scan on idx_age_people  (cost=0.00..107.43 rows=9467 width=0) (actual time=0.931..0.931 rows=10176 loops=1)
         Index Cond: (age = 40)
 Planning Time: 0.081 ms
 Execution Time: 9.672 ms
(7 rows)
```

Alright, that output looks complex, but let's break it down.

> Pro tip: Always read the EXPLAIN output bottom up!

Here is what happens in the query plan.

1. Build a bitmap of the rows we want for age = 40 (Bitmap Index Scan)
2. Look those rows up in the table (Bitmap Heap Scan) and check to make sure age = 40

Depending on the query predicates, Postgres builds bitmaps (a data structure) on the fly that contains information about where to check for matching rows.
Since we have an index on age (idx_age_people), Postgres first checks the index.
This is followed by fetching the relevant rows from the heap.

Now, let's drop the index and see what happens.

```sql
learning_test=> DROP INDEX idx_age_people;
DROP INDEX
```

And here is the output:

```sql
learning_test=> EXPLAIN ANALYSE SELECT * FROM people WHERE age = 40;
                                                        QUERY PLAN
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Gather  (cost=1000.00..13484.03 rows=9467 width=17) (actual time=0.326..90.243 rows=10176 loops=1)
   Workers Planned: 2
   Workers Launched: 2
   ->  Parallel Seq Scan on people  (cost=0.00..11537.33 rows=3945 width=17) (actual time=0.030..70.117 rows=3392 loops=3)
         Filter: (age = 40)
         Rows Removed by Filter: 329941
 Planning Time: 0.139 ms
 Execution Time: 90.756 ms
(8 rows)
```

1. Postgres had to spawn multiple workers to do a parallel sequential scan of the table.
2. From the cost and time parameters, you can see how the performance of the query dropped significantly.

### Conclusion

Indexes will significantly improve the reading of data from the tables.
And that is important. Indexes improve only the read performance.
Indexes will slow down writes as Postgres should rebalance the B-tree on upserts.
Too many unused indexes will hamper your table performance.
Adding an index might not be the silver bullet to solve your performance issues when working with large tables.
Use them judiciously. When working with large tables, there are other strategies like partitioning to improve performance which we will discuss next.
