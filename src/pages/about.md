In my role as the Associate Director for Plaform Engineering at [Avegen](https://avegenhealth.com), I coached and mentored managers and individual contributors to build a high-performing engineering team. I have led cross-functional teams throughout the entire product lifecycle.

Four things energize me in an organisation:

- Coding :)
- Healthtech innovation that leads to a truly meaningful positive impact on patients and care providers.
- Architecting technical solutions that focus on performance, security and privacy
- Building a positive high-performance culture in engineering teams

I have been in the digital health space for over 6 years now and have had the opportunity to engage with it through two lenses:

**A. Build clinically effective digital health solutions that create a positive impact:** Over the past few years, I had the opportunity to interact with various national and international healthcare providers in various domains including the pharmaceutical industry, national health organizations, NGOs and research institutes. At heart I am a medical doctor by training and my medical expertise has helped me to approach healthcare conditions with empathy and a great understanding of itâ€™s pathophysiology.

**B. Build delightful products that stand the test of scale:** I have a panache for coding. The systems I have designed with my team and platform modules we programmed have scaled to support more than 1 million users. As an engineering leader, I was accountable for the development, quality assurance, DevOps and technical support of the platform. I have played a key role in setting up the engineering team and processes in my organization. Just like any other engineer, I have broken production. I learned from my mistakes and I have continuously upskilled myself to solve new engineering challenges.

While I have loved my current role and am proud of the journey we have taken from a start-up to a scale-up, I felt it was time for me to move on and explore new challenges and opportunities in digital health.

This personal blog is my attempt to narrate my learnings and the challenges I have faced in the realm of digital healthcare and engineering.
